# LU JSON CHALLENGE

## Overview

This is the 4th coding challenge I received from LU. The goal is to render data from an API with the functionality to search as well as a button that allows the user to load more posts.

## Current Functionality

Right now, I have the posts rendering and am working to get the author information to render within the same component.

## Next Steps

After I get everything rendering correctly, I will be able to use the post and author id to make a filter function for the posts.
